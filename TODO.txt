1. Finish implementing Roamer changes. Maybe set so that roamers get EventScript_ReleaseEnd
   mid-game?
2. Randomize Trainer teams as well, including bosses and adjust leveling. (see above)
2.2. each trainer class can have associated "sensible" distributions of pokemon to sample from.
     each specific trainer may also have associated nearby routes.
     idea: for a given trainer, sample from nearby route encounters (generated random sample) for
     subset of the team. then for rest or the team, sample from broader sensible dist for trainer class.
     more diversity + cohesion for trainer teams.
     can also have different "evolution levels" from wild "evolution levels" to evolve pokemon earlier.
     could consider adding some special trainers from johto like gym leaders.
     Could use these to also randomize leveling, and tie leveling to gyms/trainer encounter randomization.
     Gym/trainer/etc battle randomization could also be tied to ecological area where they show up + extras,
     so it feels like a true random version of the game.
2.5. Also adjust leveling of encounters. (see above)
3. Add Hoenn pokemon to SEVII islands postgame.
4. Add rest of legendaries.
5. Could consider removing progress blocks and randomizing
   gym leader level ordering.
