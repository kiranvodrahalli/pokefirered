-3. Don't require randomization for rebuilds of the game! (edit makefile to make it an option to not re-randomize).
-2. Check that we have assigned every base pokemon to a habitat. also check cleffa.
-1. Rework randomized encounters a bit:
    - grass encounters: 20/20/10/10/10/10/5/5/4/4/1/1 are the rates.
      currently, for low/med diversity, slots 11/12 are guaranteed to be not rare.
    - for high diversity, last slot samples are guaranteed to be present elsewhere.
    - so there are no truly 1% random pokemon in the game.
    - rework sampling strategy so that there are some added in slot 11/12 properly.
    - water: 60/30/5/4/1 - check this. same for rock smash.
    - fish: old rod: 70/30 | good rod 60/20/20 | super rod 40/30/15/10/5
    - check fishing level randomization, it seems very off (lv 36 krabby near vermillion?)
    - pokemon you can only capture with better rods or surf locked in SS Anne?
    - so take these into account when allowing for rarity levels.
    - TRY TO MAKE SINGLE EVOs 1% encounters!!
    - need to align the sampling method so that final encounter rates
    - align with individual pokemon rarity.
    - Second: change low/med diversity a bit. 
    -         - low can be 4 pokemon, but last 2 should be way rarer.
    -         - for med, 8 is too high. make it 6 max, and last two should be way rarer.
    -         - for high diversity, 12 is ok as long as some are very rare.
0. Check fishing implementation + allow for fishing rods early. definitely fix fishing levels, too high.
   adjust by rod category, etc (but still allow for the 3x random increase, only on good/super rod).
0.1 For move tutors - remove text that says "this move can only be learned once".
0.2 Add XD/Gale of Darkness/ Emerald Tutor moves + Egg moves possibilities.
0.3. Increase num. poke balls? lower cost of poke ball?
0.5. Check rock smash encounters and update.
0.6. Re-usable TMs? or nah. (just make TMs re-gettable?)
0.7. Add premier ball bonus?
0.8. enable re-purchaseable/ re-gettable TMs
0.9. Add random 3x increase to max level on rarer encounters - to simulate much more powerful Pokemon
    similar to legends arceus. mini bosses in wild battles.
1. Finish implementing Roamer changes. Maybe set so that roamers get EventScript_ReleaseEnd
   mid-game?
2. Randomize Trainer teams as well, including bosses and adjust leveling. (see above)
2.2. each trainer class can have associated "sensible" distributions of pokemon to sample from.
     each specific trainer may also have associated nearby routes.
     idea: for a given trainer, sample from nearby route encounters (generated random sample) for
     subset of the team. then for rest or the team, sample from broader sensible dist for trainer class.
     more diversity + cohesion for trainer teams.
     can also have different "evolution levels" from wild "evolution levels" to evolve pokemon earlier.
     could consider adding some special trainers from johto like gym leaders.
     Could use these to also randomize leveling, and tie leveling to gyms/trainer encounter randomization.
     Gym/trainer/etc battle randomization could also be tied to ecological area where they show up + extras,
     so it feels like a true random version of the game.
2.3. Can also make it customized to the randomization in the region: use the common / non-common /etc.
     encounters that are generated to also pick trainer and gym leader encounters.
     For gym leaders, can also filter by type.
2.4 S.S. Anne trainers should have Hoenn Pokemon mixed in.
2.5 Implement SS Anne returning as a function of number of times you beat E4 â€” not return every time
    though, maybe once every 10 E4 defeats? Have randomized updated teams as well, and esp. with more
    "foreign" Pokemon.
3. Randomize starter choices - allow Gen I/II starters, Pikachu, Eevee. Only one of each
   type in a given set of 3 starters.
3.1 Could think of a reasonable way to expand starter selection set. but unsure if it's good.
3.2 Randomize in-game trades too?
4. Add Hoenn pokemon to SEVII islands postgame.
5. Add rest of legendaries.
6. Could consider removing progress blocks and randomizing
   gym leader level ordering.
7. swap out sprites to have good ones from emerald and good ones from frlg.
8. Remove 100 lv cap -> 200.  locked behind conditions. increase E4 level + difficulty too.
